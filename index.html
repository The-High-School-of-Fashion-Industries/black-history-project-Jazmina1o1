    <p> 
Katherine Johnson was an African-American mathematician whose calculations of space/orbital mechanics were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. manned spaceflights. Born in 1918 she showed a great talent in mathematics from a young age. Johnson's work at NASA as her calculations were very helpful for the success of the first and subsequent U.S. manned spaceflights. She was one of the first African-American women to work at NASA. Johnson's contributions to the space program were significant, and she helped piloting Apollo 11 to the moon landing. Her work was recognized with numerous awards and honors including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015. Katherine Johnson's legacy continues to inspire future scientists and mathematicians and her story serves as a reminder/memorie of the importance of diversity and more in STEM fields.
