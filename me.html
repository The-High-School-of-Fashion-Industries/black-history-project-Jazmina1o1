</h2>
<p>
    I found Katherine Johnson to be a mirror for me because I can relate to her liking for math and her passion for learning. I also admire her perseverance and determination in overcoming the obstacles she faced as an African American woman in STEM when others looked down on her but she didnt let that get in her way or stop her from achiving her dreams. She is a role model for me and many others who want to pursue a career in Math or Science and make a difference in the world. Her story inspires me to keep pushing forward and never give up on my goals, no matter what challenges I may face or what any one says.
